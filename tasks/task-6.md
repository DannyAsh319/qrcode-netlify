- Set up netlify
- attach to githib (meybe need a new github repo)
- create simple web page
- deploy and open using netlify address
- Create function that returns a list of items (not from database) like :

  [{

      "name" : "meatballs"
      "date" " "2020-04-01T23:28:56.782Z",
      "photo" : "https://www.oakhousefoods.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/336111bc363ebdc007831e2145326566/8/7/875.jpg"

  },
  {

      "name" : "chilli"
      "date" " "2020-06-01T23:28:56.782Z",
      "photo" : "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/12/dining/12JPCHILI2/12JPCHILI2-articleLarge-v3.jpg"

  }]

  - Call function from a button and show above on screen

  -- try and make it look nice, using something like this
